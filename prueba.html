        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>The Shining is a 1980 psychological horror film produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick and co-written with novelist Diane Johnson. 
        The film is based on Stephen King's 1977 novel of the same name and stars Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Scatman Crothers, 
        and Danny Lloyd. The film follows Jack Torrance (Nicholson), an aspiring writer and recovering alcoholic, 
        who accepts a position as the off-season caretaker of the isolated historic Overlook Hotel in the Colorado Rockies. 
        His family accompanies him on this job, including his young son Danny Torrance (Lloyd), who possesses "the shining", 
        an array of psychic abilities that allow him to see into the hotel's horrific past. 
        Soon after settling in, the family is trapped in the hotel by a snowstorm, and Jack gradually falls into a dangerous 
        paranormal psychosis.</p>
